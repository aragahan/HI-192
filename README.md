# HI-192

Group project for HI 192 (Knowledge Representation & Health Decision Support System) 

- Glaucoma Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
- Utilizes Python as the main programming language
- Dataset underwent preprocessing such as normalization, image shuffling, and augmentation before an 80-20 train-test split
- Compared the predictive performance of 3 base CNN models to 3 existing models (VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3)
